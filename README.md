# <h3> ElasticSearch With Kibana -- Using Docker


Basic application including basic principles of elasticsearch w/ kibana using docker.

The most important settings are available from Program.cs

Another important thing is the care with the docker configuration through the docker-compose.yml file. What space or character out of the expected can give you good hours of headache.


I could not fail to mention https://github.com/jslucas22 in this project, as it helped me at the beginning of this project, mainly with the docker-compose.yml file.
